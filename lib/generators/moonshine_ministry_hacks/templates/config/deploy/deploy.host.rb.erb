# In order to facilitate copying sensitive files to the server, such
# as certs and database.yml, the ministry hacks moonshine setup gives
# two options:
#
#   a) copy sensitive files from a remote, secure locations
# or
#   b) use the version on the server in the shared directory
#
# If there are files in app/manifests/assets/private, they must be in the
# structure specified below.  They are removed from your local computer
# after a deploy.
#
# You must manually run cap download_private, it's not run as a before task,
# but they will be deleted after deploy or deploy:setup.  If you want to
# override the default download_private which pulls the files from a remote
# location, you can do so by implementing it in this file.
#
# At the end of download_private, app/manifests/assets/private should have
#
# certs
#   <domain>.cert
#   <domain>.key
# <site>.<stage>.<domain>
#   database.yml
#
# where <stage> is one of prod, dev, staging.
#
# For example:
#
# certs
#   campusforchrist.org
# pulse.dev.campusforchrist.org
#   database.yml
# pulse.prod.campusforchrist.org
#   database.yml
# pulse.staging.campusforchrist.org
#   database.yml
# pulse.dev.campusforchrist.org
#   database.yml
#
#task :download_private
#end
